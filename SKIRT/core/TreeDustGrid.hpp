/** TreeDustGrid is an abstract subclass of the BoxDustGrid class, and represents three-dimensional
    dust grids with cuboidal cells organized in a tree. The tree's root node encloses the complete
    spatial domain, and nodes on subsequent levels recursively divide space into ever finer nodes.
    The depth of the tree can vary from place to place. The leaf cells (those that are not further
    subdivided) are the actual dust cells. The type of TreeNode used by the TreeDustGrid
    is decided in each subclass through a factory method. Depending on the type of TreeNode, the
    tree can become an octtree (8 children per node) or a kd-tree (2 children per node). Other node
    types could be implemented, as long as they are cuboids lined up with the axes. */

    /** This function verifies that all attribute values have been appropriately set and actually
        constructs the tree. The first step is to create the root node (through the factory method
        createRoot() to be implemented in each subclass), and store it in the tree vector, which is
        just a list of pointers to nodes). The second phase is to recursively subdivide the root
        node and add the children at the end of the tree vector, until all nodes satisfy the
        criteria for no further subdivision. When this task is accomplished, the function creates a
        vector that contains the node IDs of all leaves. This is the actual dust cell vector (only
        the leaf nodes are the actual dust cells). The function also creates a vector with the cell
        numbers of all the nodes, i.e. the rank \f$m\f$ of the node in the ID vector if the node is
        a leaf, and the number -1 if the node is not a leaf (and hence not a dust cell). Finally,
        the function logs some details on the number of nodes and the number of cells, and if
        writeFlag() returns true, it writes the distribution of the grid cells to a file. */

    /** This function, only to be called during the construction phase, investigates whether a node
        should be further subdivided and also takes care of the actual subdivision. There are
        several criteria for subdivision. The simplest criterion is the level of subdivision of the
        node: if it is less then a minimum level, the node is always subdivided, if it higher then
        a maximum level, there is no subdivision (these levels are input parameters). In the
        general case, whether or not we subdivide depends on the following criterion: if the ratio
        of the dust mass in the cell and the total dust mass, corresponding to the dust density
        distribution \f$\rho({\bf{r}})\f$, is larger than a preset threshold (an input parameter as
        well), the node is subdivided. The dust mass in the cell is calculated by generating
        \f$N_{\text{random}}\f$ random positions \f${\bf{r}}_n\f$ in the node, so that the total
        mass using the density in these points is given by \f[ M \approx \frac{\Delta x\, \Delta
        y\, \Delta z}{N_{\text{random}}} \sum_{n=0}^{N_{\text{random}}} \rho({\bf{r}}_n), \f] If
        the mass criterion is not satisfied, the node is not subdivided. If the conditions for
        subdivision are met, the first task is to calculate the division point. There are two
        options: geocentric division and barycentric division (an input flag again). In the former
        case, the division point of the cell is just the geometric centre, i.e. \f[ {\bf{r}}_c =
        (x_c,y_c,z_c) = \left( \frac{x_{\text{min}}+x_{\text{max}}}{2},
        \frac{y_{\text{min}}+y_{\text{max}}}{2}, \frac{z_{\text{min}}+z_{\text{max}}}{2} \right).
        \f] In the latter case the division point is the centre of mass, which we estimate using
        the \f$N_{\text{random}}\f$ points generated before, \f[ {\bf{r}}_c = \frac{ \sum_n
        \rho({\bf{r}}_n)\, {\bf{r}}_n}{ \sum_n \rho({\bf{r}}_n) }. \f] The last task is to actually
        create the eight child nodes of the node and add them to the tree. */

        tree dust grid, the function uses a rather straighforward algorithm. It determines the dust
        cell that contains the starting position, and calculates the first wall of the cell that
        will be crossed. The pathlength \f$\Delta s\f$ is determined and the current position is

        small extra bit, we ensure that the new position is now within the next cell, and we can
