/**
The AdaptiveMeshAsciiFile class can read the relevant information on a cartesian
three-dimensional (3D) Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) grid from a file in an ASCII format
defined specifically for this purpose.

The mesh data must be supplied as a regular text file with the format described here. The
overall makeup of the file reflects the tree structure described for the AdaptiveMeshFile
class. Each line describes a particular tree node (nonleaf or leaf), and the lines are given in
Morton order. Specifically, each line in the file is treated a separate entity and can be of
one of the following types:
 - Comment: lines having a crosshatch (#) as the first non-whitespace character, lines
   containing only whitespace and empty lines are ignored (and do not count in the Morton order).
 - Nonleaf: a nonleaf line has an exclamation mark (!) as the first non-whitespace character,
   followed by optional whitespace and then three whitespace-separated positive integer numbers
   \f$N_x,N_y,N_z\f$. These three numbers specify the number of child nodes carried by this node
   in each spatial direction. The child nodes are on a regular linear grid as described above.
 - Leaf: a leaf node contains one or more whitespace-separated floating point numbers, giving
   the \f$N_{fields}\f$ values of the fields in the cell represented by this leaf node. The
   first number provides the value for field \f$F_0\f$, the second for \f$F_1\f$, and so on.
   All leaf node lines in the file must contain the same number of field values.

The mesh shown in the illustration for the AdaptiveMeshFile class could be defined as follows:

# Example file for importing adaptive mesh data into SKIRT
# It defines the 2D mesh described in the class documentation
# For illustrative purposes:
#  - the mesh is assumed to have a single cell in the z direction
#  - the first field value indicates the Morton order index of the leaf cell
#  - the second and third field values indicate the x and y coordinates of
#    the cell's center using a domain with size 4. x 3. placed at the origin
