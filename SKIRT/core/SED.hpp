/** SED is the general abstract class that describes spectral energy distributions. An SED object
    is essentially a vector \f$L_\ell\f$ that contains the fraction of the total luminosity emitted
    in each of the wavelength bins of the simulation's wavelength grid. By definition, the
    \f$L_\ell\f$ vector is always normalized as \f[ \sum_{\ell=0}^{N_\lambda-1} L_\ell = 1. \f]
    Note that this is different from the emissivity \f$j(\lambda)\f$, which is the power emitted
    per unit wavelength. Each SED subclass is responsible for initializing the luminosity vector
    during setup by calling one of the functions provided for this purpose by this base class. */
