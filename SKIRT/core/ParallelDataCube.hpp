/** An object of this class represents a data cube of which the slices per wavelength are
    distributed across the different processes. It acts as a table indexed on wavelengths and
    pixels, with respectively the first and second index of its ()-operator. It makes use of the \c
    ProcessAssigner contained in the \c WavelengthGrid to check and convert the given wavelength
    index. At the end of a simulation, the data stored across the different processes can be
    gathered at the root process using an MPI communication. When the wavelengths are evenly
    divided across the processes, the memory usage per process is expected to scale as 1/N, with N
    the number of processes. When data parallelization is not active, there will be no wavelength
    assigner, and this object will store data for all wavelengths. */

        the data cube, used in log messages. The number of pixels per frame is given as the second
        argument. Using the given \c SimulationItem, this function gains access to the simulation
        hierarchy, allowing it to look for the \c WavelengthGrid and the \c PeerToPeerCommunicator.
        Via the wavelength grid, the wavelength assigner can be obtained. From the wavelength
        assigner, it is determined what size the \c _partialCube data member should be, and the

        created data cube can be transferred and copying of the data is avoided. All processes need
        to call this function together, as it uses a collective MPI communication. In
        non-distributed mode, a summation is performed, adding the flux contributions from every
        process, and the result is stored at the root process. The processes other than the root do
        not need the complete cube, as only the root will write the data to disk. Therefore, the
        return value is a pointer to an empty array for all non-root processes. */
