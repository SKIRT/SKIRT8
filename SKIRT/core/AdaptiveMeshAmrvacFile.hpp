/** The AdaptiveMeshAmrvacFile class can read the relevant information on a cartesian
    three-dimensional (3D) Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) grid from a file in the format produced
    by the MPI-AMRVAC code developed in Leuven; see for example Keppens et al 2012. The web pages
    http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~keppens/amrstructure.html and
    http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~keppens/fileformat.html provide an overview of the data format.
    Specific information was obtained from a python script kindly written for this purpose by Tom
    Hendrix.

    This class only supports cartesian grids. It converts 1D and 2D grids to 3D grids by assuming
    a thickness of 1 cell in the missing directions.

    For some reason the MPI-AMRVAC data file does not contain the size of the mesh at the coarsest
    level. This information must be provided separately as part of the ski file.
