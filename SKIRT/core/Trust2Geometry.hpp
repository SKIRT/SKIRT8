/** The Trust2Geometry class is a subclass of the GenGeometry class and describes the geometry of two
    constant density spheres, embedded in a low-density medium. It is to be used as one of the benchmark
    models for the suite of TRUST 3D benchmark models. Contrary to the model presciption, we have moved
    the entire geometry so that the centre of the coordinate system is located at the centre of the
    system. More precisely, the density can be written as a sum of three components, \f[ \rho({\bf{r}})
    = \rho_0({\bf{r}}) + \rho_1({\bf{r}}) + \rho_2({\bf{r}}), \f] where each of the three densities are
    constant within the boundaries of their volume. For the low-density component, we have a cubic
    volume of size \f$2L_0 \times 2L_0 \times 2L_0\f$, with \f$L_0 = 30~{\text{AU}}\f$. From this cube,
    a spherical part is carved out; the centre of this sphere is located at the bottom-left-front corner
    and the radius of the sphere is \f$R_0 = 15~{\text{AU}}\f$. The second component is a sphere of
    radius \f$R_1 = 5~{\text{AU}}\f$ and it is centered at the position \f${\bf{r}}_1 = (-20~{\text{AU}},
    -15~{\text{AU}},-10~{\text{AU}})\f$. Finally, the third component is a second sphere of radius
    \f$R_2 = 20~{\text{AU}}\f$, centered at the position \f${\bf{r}}_2 = (-10/3~{\text{AU}},
    5/3~{\text{AU}},-5/3~{\text{AU}})\f$. The relative weights of these three components is set by the
    requirement that the surface mass densities of the three components (through their centres) have
    the ratio 1:10000:1000. This leads to total mass contributions of 0.2616%, 38.3609%, and
    61.3775% respectively.  */
