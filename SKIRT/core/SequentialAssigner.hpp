/** The SequentialAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects
    that assign work to different processes. The SequentialAssigner does this by dividing the work
    (consisting of many parts) in sequential sections, where each section contains more or less the
    same number of parts. Then, each process is assigned to a different section, according to their
    rank. If a certain method in another class incorporates an object of the SequentialAssigner
    class for performing a set of tasks (or parts of work), each process will execute a different
    subset of these tasks. After performing this work in parallel, communication is typically
    needed to accumulate the results stored at different processes. */

    //============= Construction - Setup - Destruction =============

public:
    /** This constructor can be invoked by SKIRT classes that wish to hard-code the creation of a
        new ProcessAssigner object of this type. Before the constructor returns, the newly created
        object is hooked up as a child to the specified parent in the simulation hierarchy (so it
        will automatically be deleted) and the setup of the ProcessAssigner base class is invoked,
        which sets the _comm attribute that points to the object of type PeerToPeerCommunicator
        that is found in the simulation hierarchy. As a second argument, it takes the number of
        parts of work \f$n\f$ that need to be performed. Based on this number, the number of
        processes and the rank of this process, the number of tasks that are assigned to this
        process are determined and stored in the \c _assigned member. The algorithm of this function
        goes as follows. First, from the PeerToPeerCommunicator object, the rank \f$i\f$ and size
        \f$N_{P}\f$ are acquired and stored in temporary variables. Then, the quotient and the
        remainder of the integer division of \f$n\f$ and \f$N_{P}\f$ are calculated: \f[ q = \left
        \lfloor{\frac{n}{N_{P}}}\right \rfloor \f] \f[ r = n \bmod{N_{P}} \f] These two values are
        respectively stored in the private \c _quotient and \c _remainder members, for use of the
        rankForIndex() function. Next, based on \f$q\f$ and \f$r\f$, the number of values assigned
        to the process is determined. This is done based on the following simple principle: <ol>
        <li> First, hand out \f$q\f$ values to each process. <li> Then, give the first \f$r\f$
        process one value extra. </ol> With the above method, all \f$n\f$ values get
        assigned to a process, and the work load is maximally balanced (the difference in number of
        tasks between two arbitrary processes is no more than one). The number of values (or tasks)
        as calculated based on the method described above, is stored in the _assigned member. The
        last thing the assign function calculates is the starting value for the particular process.
        This is done by differentiating between two seperate cases: <ul> <li> Either the rank
        \f$i\f$ of the process is smaller than \f$r\f$, <li> or \f$i\f$ is greater than or equal to
        \f$r\f$. </ul> In the former case, the starting index is given by: \f[ t_0 = i \cdot ( q +
        1 ) \f] In the latter case, this index is given by: \f[ t_0 = r \cdot ( q + 1) + (i - r)
        \cdot q \f] The resulting value is stored in the private \c _start member of this class,
        for use in the absoluteIndex() function. */
