    the top), and a run-time object hierarchy using the Item parent/children mechanism (usually
    with an instance of a MonteCarloSimulation subclass at the top). */

        sets any attributes to null values rather than to meaningful defaults (to avoid the extra
        construction time). Thus all attributes in the simulation hierarchy must have been
        explicitly set by the caller before invoking setup(). If setup() has already been invoked

        The function searches for an appropriate item among all ancestors of the receiving item
        (including the receiving item itself) and their immediate children. In other words, it
        recursively runs upwards along the ancestors and goes just one level down for each
        ancestor. The function returns the first appropriate item found; if multiple items of the
        same type exist in the hierarchy, there is no telling which one of these will be returned.

        If the \em setup flag is true (the default value), the function invokes the setup()
        function on the item before it is returned; if no appropriate item is found, a FatalError
        is thrown. If the \em setup flag is false, the function does not perform setup on
        the item, and if no appropriate item is found, the function returns a null pointer. */

        function returns a pointer to it, or rather to the simulation item that implements the
        interface after it has been dynamically cast to the requested interface type. If no
        interface of the requested type is found, the function returns a null pointer. Thus the
        caller must check the returned pointer before dereferencing it.

        By default only the receiving simulation item is considered as a candidate for implementing
