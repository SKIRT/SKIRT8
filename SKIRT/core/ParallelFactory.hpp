/** A ParallelFactory object serves as a factory for instances of the Parallel class, called its
    children. An important attribute of a factory object is the maximum number of parallel
    execution threads to be handed to its children. When requesting a new child, the client can
    specify a more stringent limit on the number of threads, but the factory's limit is never
    exceeded. This allows a client to request a Parallel object with a smaller number of threads,
    usually for performance reasons, while still sharing the thread indexing mechanism provided by
    the currentThreadIndex() function. A factory object assumes ownership for all its children. If
    a child with the appropriate number of threads already exists, it will be handed out again.

    A particular Parallel instance can be reused many times for calling various member functions in
    various objects, reducing the overhead of creating and destroying the threads. However all
    children of a particular factory share the same thread pool (at least logically if not
    physically), so they should \em never be used in parallel. Specifically, recursively invoking
    the call() function on the same Parallel instance is not allowed and results in undefined
    behavior. The recommended use is to have a single ParallelFactory instance per simulation, and
    to use yet another ParallelFactory instance to run multiple simulations at the same time.

    During construction of a ParallelFactory instance, the maximum thread count is set to the
    return value of the defaultThreadCount() function. */
