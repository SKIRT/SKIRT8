/** VoronoiMeshFile is an abstract class used to read the relevant information on a cartesian
    three-dimensional Voronoi mesh from a data file. The VoronoiMeshFile subclasses implement
    specific file formats, including a generic ASCII format.

    For the purposes of this class, a Voronoi mesh represents any number of scalar fields over a
    given three-dimensional spatial domain. The Voronoi mesh partitions the domain in cells
    according to a Voronoi tesselation of the domain. Consider a given set of points in the domain,
    called particles. For each particle there will be a corresponding region consisting of all
    points in the domain closer to that particle than to any other. These regions are called
    Voronoi cells, and together they form the Voronoi tesselation of the domain. Each Voronoi cell
    holds a single value per field (i.e. the fields are considered to be constant over each cell).

    A Voronoi tesselation is fully defined by the locations of the generating particles. Thus
    an instance of this class (or rather of one of its subclasses) supplies the mesh data to the
    caller as a sequence of \em particle \em records, in arbitary order. Each record provides the
    coordinates of a particle plus the values of the fields in the cell surrounding this particle.
    All records in the file must contain the same number of field values \f$N_{fields}\f$.

    Note that the data provided by this class does not specify the domain geometry or size, the
    meaning of the represented fields, nor the units in which the field values are expressed.
    However the particle coordinates returned by this class are always given in SI units, as is
    usual for SKIRT internals.
