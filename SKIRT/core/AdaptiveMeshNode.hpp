    individual nodes in a tree data structure. An AdaptiveMeshNode instance can represent
    a leaf or a nonleaf node. A nonleaf node maintains a list of pointers to its children.
    A leaf node instead keeps a list of pointers to the most likely neighbor for each of the
    six cell walls. For more information, refer to the AdaptiveMesh class. */
