/** ProcessAssigner is an abstract class representing objects that assign different parts of work
    to the different processes in the simulation. Different subclasses of ProcessAssigner do this
    in different ways. A ProcessAssigner is always used in combination with the
    PeerToPeerCommunicator of the simulation. The latter defines the communications needed between
    the processes, while the former defines the work assignment. The MasterSlaveCommunicator
    implements the work assignment itself; letting one process hand out the parts of work to the
    others by sending messages. The construction of ProcessAssigner subclass instances is hardcoded
    in the SimulationItem class setting up the assignment scheme, usually during setup. In other
    words, process assigners are not configured externally by the user. Still, the ProcessAssigner
    class inherits from SimulationItem so that it can be linked into the simulation item hierarchy
    at run time. This provides the process assigner with a way to access the PeerToPeerCommunicator
    of the simulation, and ensures proper destruction with the simulation hierarchy itself. */

        implemented differently in each of the subclasses, and typically involves some calculations
        to determine which process is assigned to which parts of the work. The second argument
        specifies the immediate parent of the new process assigner instance in the simulation item
