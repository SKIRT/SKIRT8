/** The SPHGeometry class describes an arbitrary 3D geometry from a set of SPH gas particles, such
    as for example resulting from a cosmological simulation. The information on the SPH gas
    particles is read from a file formatted as described below. The total mass in the geometry is
    normalized to unity after importing the data, so the units of the mass values in the data file
    are in fact irrelevant.

    The input text file should contain 6 or 7 columns of numbers separated by whitespace; lines
    starting with # are ignored. The first three columns are the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$
    coordinates of the particle (in pc), the fourth column is the SPH smoothing length \f$h\f$ (in
    pc), the fifth column is the mass \f$M\f$ of the particle (in \f$M_\odot\f$; the total mass in
    the geometry will be normalized to unity after importing the data, so the mass units in the
    data file are in fact irrelevant), and the sixth column is the metallicity \f$Z\f$ of the gas
    (dimensionless fraction). The optional seventh column is the temperature of the gas (in K). If
    this value is provided and it is higher than the maximum temperature the particle is ignored.
    If the temperature value is missing, the particle is never ignored. */
