/** The CubBackgroundGeometry class is a subclass of the Geometry class. It represents the surface
    (i.e. the combination of the six walls) of a cube from which radiation escapes in the inward
    direction. The emissivity is anisotropic: there is no radiation outwards and the inward
    emissivity from each wall is proportional to \f$\cos\theta'\f$, where \f$\theta'\f$ is the
    angle between the direction and the normal on the wall. */

        \sqrt{{\cal{X}}_1} \\ \varphi' &= 2\pi\,{\cal{X}}_2. \end{split} \f] Once these values
        have been determined, we need to rotate such that the Z' axis is perpendicular to the
