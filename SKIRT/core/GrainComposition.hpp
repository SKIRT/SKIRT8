/** GrainComposition is an abstract class that represents the optical and calorimetric properties
    of a population of dust grains with a given chemical composition.

    The optical properties are provided for arbitrary grain sizes and at arbitrary wavelengths; in
    practice, they are defined on a two-dimensional grid of wavelengths \f$\lambda_k\f$ and grain
    sizes \f$a_i\f$. The optical properties include the absorption and scattering efficiencies
    \f$Q_{k,i}^{\text{abs}}\f$ and \f$Q_{k,i}^{\text{sca}}\f$ and the scattering phase function
    asymmetry parameter \f$g_{k,i}\f$.

    The calorimetric properties include the bulk mass density \f$\rho_\text{bulk}\f$ (a single
    value), and the specific enthalpy at arbitrary temperature. The specific enthalpy is the
    internal energy per unit mass, using an arbitrary zero point, obtained by integrating the
    specific heat capacity of the material over the temperature range. In practice, the specific
    enthalpy is defined on a grid of temperatures \f$T_t\f$ resulting in a set of values \f$h_t\f$.

    The GrainComposition class provides a public interface for retrieving the values of the optical
    and calorimetric properties, properly interpolated for arbitrary wavelength, grain size, and/or
    temperature values. These public functions use the underlying property values stored in private
    data members defined in this class. Subclasses are required to initialize these data members
    during setup, using the protected functions offered by this class. */

        text format as described here. Any initial lines that start with a # character are
        considered to be part of a header and are thus ignored. The first number on the first
        non-header line specifies the number of grain size grid points \f$N_a\f$; the first number
        on the second non-header line specifies the number of wavelength grid points
        \f$N_\lambda\f$. Subsequently there must be \f$N_a\f$ blocks containing \f$N_\lambda+1\f$
        lines each. The first number on the first line in each block provides the grain size value
        for this block (in micron); blocks must be in order of increasing grain size. Subsequent
        lines in the block provide information for the various wavelengths at this grain size. If
        the \em reverse flag is false, these lines are in order of increasing wavelength, otherwise
        they are in order of decreasing wavelength. All data lines in a block must have 4 to 7

        is present, false means it is absent). The wavelength must be given in micron; the other
        three values are dimensionless. For all lines discussed above, any additional information
        at the end of the line is ignored. */

    /** This function should be used by a subclass to read the complete grid with optical

         - the wavelength grid \f$\lambda_k\f$, in increasing order;
         - the grain sizes \f$a_i\f$ plus the absorption and scattering efficiencies
           \f$Q_{k,i}^{\text{abs}}\f$ and \f$Q_{k,i}^{\text{sca}}\f$ on the two-dimensional grid;
         - the grain sizes \f$a_i\f$ plus the scattering phase function asymmetry parameter
           \f$g_{k,i}\f$ on the same grid; the grain sizes values must be identical in both files.

        The files should have a simple text format as described here. For all files, any initial
        lines that start with a # character are considered to be part of a header and are thus
        ignored. Also, for all lines discussed below, any additional information at the end of the
        line is ignored.

        In the wavelength grid file, the first number on the first non-header line specifies the
        number of wavelength grid points \f$N_\lambda\f$. The first number on each subsequent line
        specifies a wavelength grid point \f$\lambda_k\f$ in (micron).

        The efficiencies file contains three blocks, each optionally starting with a header
        consisting of lines that start with a # characters. In the first block, the first number on
        the first non-header line specifies the number of grain size grid points \f$N_a\f$. The
        second line has \f$N_a\f$ columns specifying the grain sizes \f$a_i\f$ (in micron), in
        increasing order. The second block contains \f$N_\lambda\f$ non-header lines. Each line
        specifies the \f$N_a\f$ absorption efficiencies \f$Q_{k,i}^{\text{abs}}\f$ corresponding to
        line (wavelength) \f$k\f$ and column (grain size) \f$i\f$. Similarly, the third block
        contains \f$N_\lambda\f$ non-header lines. Each line now specifies the \f$N_a\f$ scattering
        efficiencies \f$Q_{k,i}^{\text{sca}}\f$ corresponding to line (wavelength) \f$k\f$ and
        column (grain size) \f$i\f$.

        The scattering assymetry parameter file similarly contains two blocks. The first block
        describes the grain size grid and should be identical to the first block in the
        efficiencies file. The second block again contains \f$N_\lambda\f$ non-header lines. Each
        line now specifies the \f$N_a\f$ scattering assymetry parameters \f$g_{k,i}\f$
        corresponding to line (wavelength) \f$k\f$ and column (grain size) \f$i\f$. */

        character are considered to be part of a header and are thus ignored. The first number on
        the first non-header line specifies the number of temperature grid points \f$N_T\f$. The
        remaining lines tabulate the enthalpy for increasing temperature. Each line must have two
        columns specifying the temperature \f$T_t\f$ (in K) and the corresponding enthalpy
        \f$h_t\f$ (in erg/g). Any additional information at the end of a line is ignored. */

        heat capacity in function of the logarithm of temperature, from the resource data file with
        the specified name, and calculate an appropriate enthalpy grid through interpolation and
        integration of the values in the table.

        Since this function needs to convert the heat capacity (or enthalpy) per unit volume to the
        corresponding quantity per unit mass, the bulk mass density \f$\rho_\text{bulk}\f$ of the
        dust grains must have been set through setBulkDensity() \em before calling this function.

        The file should have a simple text format as described here. Any initial lines that start
        with a # character are considered to be part of a header and are thus ignored. The first
        two non-header lines are ignored as well. The third non-header line specifies the number of
        temperature grid points \f$N_T\f$. The remaining lines tabulate the heat capacity for
        increasing temperature. Each line must have two columns specifying the base 10 logarithm of
        the temperature \f$\log T_t\f$ (in K) and the base 10 logarithm of the corresponding heat
        capacity per unit volume \f$\log C_t\f$ (in erg/K/cm3). Any additional information at the
        end of a line is ignored.

        This function first interpolates the heat capacity data read from the resource file to a
        grid with an appropriate (typically much larger) number of grid points, using linear
        interpolation in log-log space. Then it performs the integration to calculate the enthalpy,
        using the following substitution: \f[ H(T) = \int_0^T C(T')\,{\text{d}}T' = \ln 10
        \int_{-\infty}^{\log T} 10^{\log C(\log T')} 10^{\log T'} \,{\text{d}}\log T' \f] There is
        no need to determine the correct zero point of the integral, since the specificenthalpy()
        function returns enhalpy values with an arbitrary zero point. Finally the function converts
        the enthalpy values to the appropriate units. */
