/** The SPHStellarComp class represents a stellar component defined from a set of SPH source
    particles, such as for example resulting from a cosmological simulation. The information on the
    SPH source particles is read from a file formatted as described below.

    The input text file should contain columns of numbers separated by whitespace; lines starting
    with # are ignored. The first three columns are the \f$x\f$, \f$y\f$ and \f$z\f$ coordinates of
    the particles (in pc) and the fourth column is the SPH smoothing length \f$h\f$ (in pc). If the
    \em velocity flag is set to true, the subsequent three columns (i.e. the fifth through the
    seventh columns) contain the \f$v_\mathrm{x}\f$, \f$v_\mathrm{y}\f$ and \f$v_\mathrm{z}\f$
    components of the particle's velocity (in km/s). If the \em velocity flag is set to false,
    these columns are not present.

    The number and interpretation of the subsequent columns depends on the %SED family specified as
    a property to this particular SPHStellarComp instance.

    For the Bruzual-Charlot %SED family, the remaining three columns provide the properties of the
    stellar population. The fifth column is the initial mass of the stellar population (in
    \f$M_\odot\f$ at \f$t=0\f$), the sixth column is the metallicity \f$Z\f$ of the stellar
    population (dimensionless fraction), and the seventh column is the age of the stellar
    population (in yr).

    For the Mappings III %SED family, the remaining five columns provide the properties of the
    corresponding HII region in the following order: the star formation rate \f$\dot{M}\f$, assumed
    to be constant over the past 10 Myr (in \f$M_\odot\,{\text{yr}}^{-1}\f$), metallicity \f$Z\f$
    (as a dimensionless fraction), the logarithm of the compactness \f$\log C\f$ (as a
    dimensionless fraction), the ISM pressure \f$p\f$ (in Pa), and the dimensionless PDR covering
    factor \f$f_{\text{PDR}}\f$.

        has been determined, a position is determined randomly from the smoothed distribution
        around the particle centre, a random propagation direction is determined, and a photon
        package with these properties is constructed and returned. The function assumes the scaled
