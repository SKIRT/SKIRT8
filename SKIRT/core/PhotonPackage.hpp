/** The PhotonPackage class is used to describe photon packages, the basic luminosity packets that
    are transported during a radiative transfer simulation. Photon packages are monochromatic, i.e.
    they contain photons at a single wavelength (one of the wavelengths in the simulation's
    wavelength grid). Apart from its luminosity, wavelength and polarization state, a photon
    package carries information about its origin (e.g. emission by a star or by a dust grain),
    about the interactions it experienced since its emission (e.g. the number of scattering
    events), and about its current path (e.g. starting position, propagation direction, list of
    dust cells being crossed). The current path and the polarization state are handled by publicly
    inheriting repectively the DustGridPath class and the StokesVector class. For performance
    reasons, a PhotonPackage object is usually constructed once at the start of a loop and then
    reused in the loop body for many consecutive launches; this allows the vectors with path
    information to remain allocated. Also, some trivial functions are implemented inline in the
    header. */
