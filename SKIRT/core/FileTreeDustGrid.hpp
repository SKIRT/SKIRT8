/** FileTreeDustGrid represents hierarchical tree dust grids for which the structure is imported
    from a file previously written by an instance of the TreeDustGrid class. Depending on the
    incoming data, the tree can be an octtree (8 children per node) or a kd-tree (2 children per
    node). See TreeDustGrid for more information.

    Compatibility note: the current implementation does NOT support binary trees with a subdivision
    direction method other than alternating. No warning or error is given, but things will go wrong
    when shooting photons.

    Implementation note: the current implementation involves a substantial amount of code
    duplication from TreeDustGrid because of complications with the inheritance structure.
