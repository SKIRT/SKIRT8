/** The ProcessCommunicator class is an abstract class representing different types of
    communicators. The class inherits from SimulationItem so that it can be used within a SKIRT
    simulation hierarchy or FitSKIRT fitscheme hieararchy, and is accessible with the discovery
    mechanism. A communicator is used to represent an multiprocess environment, with a certain size
    (the number of processes) and where each process is assigned a certain rank. The communicator
    subclasses are designated for implementing the communication operations between its processes.
    Different communicators can implement different forms of communications, specific for a certain
    parallelization design. The ProcessCommunicator base class provides two data members: _rank and
    _Nprocs. These are declared private, meaning that the subclasses can only access these values
    through corresponding getter functions implemented by this class. */

        function of the ProcessManager class, which will decide whether this communicator obtains the
        MPI resource or not. If it does, the _rank and _Nprocs data members are given their true value
        according to the MPI library. If the resource is not available at the time this function is
        called, the number of processes is set to one and the rank to zero. */
