/** DustSystem is an abstract class for representing complete dust systems, including both a dust
    distribution (i.e. a complete description of the spatial distribution and optical properties of
    the dust) and a grid on which this distribution is discretized. There are specialized
    subclasses for use with oligochromatic and panchromatic simulations respectively. A DustSystem
    object contains a vector of dust cells, each of which contain all useful information on the
    dust within that particular piece of the configuration space. Furthermore, a DustSystem object
    contains pointers a DustDistribution object and to a DustGrid object). A subclass may of course
    maintain additional information depending on its needs. */

    /** This function performs setup for the dust system, which includes several tasks. First, the
        function verifies that either all dust mixes in the dust system support polarization, or
        none of them do. The next task consists of calculating and storing the volume and the dust
        density (for every dust component) of all the cells. To calculate the volume of a given
        dust cell, we just call the corresponding function of the dust grid. To calculate and set
        the density corresponding to given dust component in a given cell, a number of random
        positions are generated within the cell (see sampleCount()). The density in the cell is
        calculated as the mean of the density values (found using a call to the corresponding
        function of the dust distribution) in these points. The calculation of both volume and
        density is parallellized. Finally, the function optionally invokes various writeXXX()
        functions depending on the state of the corresponding write flags. */

        ProcessAssigner that is used for this dust system. When a ProcessAssigner subclass is used
        which distributes the calculation of the dust cell densities amongst the different parallel
        processes, each process contains only the densities for a particular set of dust cells (but
        for each dust component). Therefore, this function uses the PeerToPeerCommunicator object
        to broadcast the densities of the dust cells assigned to a particular process to all other
        processes and storing them in the appropriate place in the container. This is implemented
        as an element-wise summation of this container across all processes, where the density for
        a particular dust cell and dust component will be added to a series of zeros, coming from
        the processes that were not assigned to that dust cell. The end result will be an assembly

        dust density of the dust distribution, i.e.\ the actual dust density that would correspond
        to an infinitely fine dust grid. The grid-discretized dust density maps on the other hand
        give the value of the dust as read from the finite-resolution dust grid. A comparison of
