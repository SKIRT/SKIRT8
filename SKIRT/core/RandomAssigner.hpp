/** The RandomAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects that
    assign work to different processes. An object of the RandomAssigner class distributes the work
    amongst the different processes in a random way. For each value (part of work), the assigned
    process is determined by drawing a uniform random number. Because the state of the random
    number generator can be different in each process, each process performs the random assignment
    for a subset of the different values, after which the results are gathered across all
    processes. */

    //============= Construction - Setup - Destruction =============

public:
    /** This constructor can be invoked by SKIRT classes that wish to hard-code the creation of a
        new ProcessAssigner object of this type. Before the constructor returns, the newly created
        object is hooked up as a child to the specified parent in the simulation hierarchy (so it
        will automatically be deleted) and the setup of the ProcessAssigner base class is invoked,
        which sets the _comm attribute that points to the object of type PeerToPeerCommunicator
        that is found in the simulation hierarchy. The second argument takes the number of parts of
        work \f$n\f$ that need to be performed. For each part of work \f$i\f$ (with \f$i\f$ ranging
        from 0 to \f$n-1\f$), the rank of the assigned process is determined, by drawing random
        numbers from a uniform distribution. By using a SequentialAssigner, the range of indices
        \f$i\f$ is split in different domains, so that each process must draw these random numbers
        only for one particular domain. Subsequently, the randomly determined ranks are
        synchronized across all processes, so that every process knows which process is assigned to
        any part of the work (stored in the _assignment vector). Each process then determines which
        values it is assigned to itself, and stores these values in a seperate list (the _values
        attribute). */

        the value in the _values list. */
