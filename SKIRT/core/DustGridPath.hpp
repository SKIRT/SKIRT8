/** A DustGridPath object contains the details of a path through a dust grid. Given a dust grid,
    i.e. an object of a DustGrid subclass, a starting position \f${\bf{r}}\f$ and a propagation
    direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$, one can calculate the path through the dust grid. A DustGridPath
    object keeps record of all the cells that are crossed by this path, together with the physical
    path length \f$\Delta s\f$ covered within each cell, and the path length \f$s\f$ covered along
    the entire path up to the end of the cell. Given additional information about the dust
    properties in each cell (at a particular wavelength), one can also calculate optical depth
    information for the path. A DustGridPath object keeps record of the optical depth
    \f$\Delta\tau\f$ along the path segment within each cell, and the optical depth \f$\tau\f$
    along the entire path up to the end of the cell. */
