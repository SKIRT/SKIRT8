/** The AdaptiveMesh class is used to import data on a cartesian three-dimensional (3D) Adaptive
    Mesh Refinement (AMR) grid into SKIRT. The constructor reads the relevant data from a data file
    in one of the supported formats. The instance methods allow interrogating the resulting data
    structure in various ways. Once an AdaptiveMesh instance has been constructed, its data is
    never modified (which is somewhat ironic in view of the class name). Consequently all methods
    are re-entrant.

    An AdaptiveMesh instance represents one or more scalar fields over a given three-dimensional
    spatial domain. The domain must be a cuboid and is defined using cartesian coordinates. The
    meaning of the fields, and the units in which the values are expressed, are not relevant for
    this class and are determined by the caller in agreement with the supplier of the data file.
    Since at least one of the fields will likely be interpreted as a density distribution over the
    domain, this class offers some specific functionality to support that use case.

    The adaptive mesh partitions the domain in cubodial cells, each holding a single value per
    field (i.e. the fields are considered to be constant over each cell). It uses a recursively
    nested linear grid structure to provide high resolution (i.e. small cells) in areas where it
    matters, without consuming memory in areas where the resolution can be lower. This structure is
    organized in a tree. Each tree node represents a cubodial portion of the domain, called its
    extent. The root node's extent is the complete domain. A nonleaf node distributes its extent over
    its child nodes using a regular linear grid. The number of subdivisions is defined separately
    for each node and can differ for each spatial dimension. A leaf node represents a cell holding
    field data values which are considered to be constant over the leaf node's extent. Collectively
    the leaf nodes form a partition of the domain, i.e. their extents cover the complete domain
    without overlapping one another.

    For more information on the supported adaptive mesh file formats, refer to the AdaptiveMeshFile
    class and its subclasses.

    /** The constructor reads the AMR data from the specified adaptive mesh file. The \em
        fieldIndices argument specifies a list of indices \f$g\f$ for the scalar fields
        \f$F_g({\bf{r}})\f$ that will be held by the newly constructed instance. The exact meaning
        of the field indices depends on the imported data file format, but usually they correspond
        to zero-based column or variable indices. The data file must contain a sufficient number of
        columns or variables to accommodate the highest index in the list; additional columns or
        variables in the file are ignored. The indices may be specified in any order, and the same
        index may be specified more than once. Negative value are ignored. The argument \em
        extent specifies the extent of the domain as a box lined up with the coordinate axes.
        Finally, the optional \em log argument specifies a logger appropriate for the simulation.
        The logger is used only for issuing warnings about stuck photons in the path() function;
        it can be omitted if the path() function is never called, or if no warnings should be
        issued. */

        factor for the density distribution. Finally, the density is always multiplied by the
        constant fraction \f$f\f$ specified by \em densityFraction (with a default value of 1). In
