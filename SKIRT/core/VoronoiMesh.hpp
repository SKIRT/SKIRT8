/** The VoronoiMesh class is used to manage a cartesian three-dimensional Voronoi mesh. It offers
    methods to interrogate the data structure in various (sometimes quite advanced) ways. Once an
    VoronoiMesh instance has been constructed, its data is never modified. Consequently all methods
    are re-entrant.

    For the purposes of this class, a Voronoi mesh represents any number (including zero) of scalar
    fields over a given cuboidal spatial domain. The Voronoi mesh partitions the domain in
    polyhedra according to a Voronoi tesselation of the domain. Consider a given set of points in
    the domain, called particles. For each particle there will be a corresponding region consisting
    of all points in the domain closer to that particle than to any other. These regions are called
    Voronoi cells, and together they form the Voronoi tesselation of the domain. Each Voronoi cell
    holds a single value per field (i.e. the fields are considered to be constant over each cell).

    There are constructors to obtain the particle coordinates and corresponding field values from
    various sources, including vectors in memory and a data file. For more information on the
    supported Voronoi mesh file formats, refer to the VoronoiMeshFile class and its subclasses.

    The extent of the cuboidal domain and all particle coordinates must be provided to this class
    in SI units. The meaning of the fields, and the units in which the values are expressed, are
    not relevant for this class and are determined by the caller in agreement with the supplier of
    the data file. Since at least one of the fields will likely be interpreted as a density
    distribution over the domain, this class offers some specific functionality to support that use
    case.

    This class uses the Voro++ code written by Chris H. Rycroft (LBL / UC Berkeley) to build the
    Voronoi tesselation.

        of the field indices depends on the imported data file format, but usually they correspond
        to zero-based column or variable indices. The data file must contain a sufficient number of
        columns or variables to accommodate the highest index in the list; additional columns or

    /** This private function is called from each constructor. Given a list of generating
        particles, it actually builds the Voronoi tesselation and stores the corresponding list of
        cells including any properties relevant for supporting the interrogation capabilities
        offered by this class. All other data (such as Voronoi cell vertices, edges and faces) is
        discarded.

        The function performs the following steps:
         - if requested, remove particles that are too close to another particle
         - add the particles to a Voro++ container, and compute the Voronoi cells one by one;
         - copy the relevant cell information (such as the list of neighboring cells) from the
           Voro++ data structures into our own;
         - build a data structure that allows fast retrieval of a list of the Voronoi cells
           possibly overlapping a given point in the domain (see below).

        To accelerate operation of the cellIndex() function, which is called quite frequently, the
        domain is partitioned yet again, this time using a linear cubodial grid. The cells in this
        grid are called \em blocks. For each block, the function builds and stores a list of all
        Voronoi cells that possibly overlap that block. Retrieving the list of cells possibly
        overlapping a given point in the domain then comes down to locating the block containing
        the point (which is trivial since the grid is linear). The current implementation uses a
        Voronoi cell's enclosing cuboid to test for intersection with a block. Performing a precise
        intersection test (which was once implemented) is \em really slow and the shortened block
        lists don't substantially accelerate the cellIndex() function.

        To further reduce the search time within blocks that overlaps with a large number of cells,
        this function builds a binary search tree on the cell particle locations for those blocks
        (see for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-tree">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-tree</a>).

        \f$D\f$ over the domain. If \em densityMultiplierField is nonnegative (the default value is

        factor for the density distribution. Finally, the density is always multiplied by the

        the point. If there is a search tree for this block, the function uses it to locate the nearest

        point to the particle positions for each of the possibly overlapping cells, determining the

    //====================== Path construction =====================

public:
    /** This function calculates a path through the grid. The DustGridPath object passed as an
        argument specifies the starting position \f${\bf{r}}\f$ and the direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$
        for the path. The data on the calculated path are added back into the same object. See the
        VoronoiMesh class for more information.

        In the first stage, the function checks whether the start point is inside the domain. If
        so, the current point is simply initialized to the start point. If not, the function
        computes the path segment to the first intersection with one of the domain walls and moves
        the current point inside the domain. Finally the function determines the current cell, i.e.
        the cell containing the current point.

        In the second stage, the function loops over the algorithm that computes the exit point
        from the current cell, i.e. the intersection of the ray formed by the current point and
        the path direction with the current cell's boundary. By the nature of Voronoi cells, this
        algorithm also produces the ID of the neigboring cell without extra cost. If an exit point
        is found, the loop adds a segment to the output path, updates the current point and the
        current cell, and continues to the next iteration. If the exit is towards a domain wall,
        the path is complete and the loop is terminated. If no exit point is found, which shouldn't
        happen too often, this must be due to computational inaccuracies. In that case, no path
        segment is added, the current point is advanced by a small amount, and the new current cell
        is determined by calling the function whichcell().

        The algorithm that computes the exit point has the following input data:

        </TABLE>

        The line containing the ray can be written as \f$\mathcal{L}(s)=\mathbf{r}+s\,\mathbf{k}\f$
        with \f$s\in\mathbb{R}\f$. The exit point can similarly be written as
        \f$\mathbf{q}=\mathbf{r}+s_q\,\mathbf{k}\f$ with \f$s_q>0\f$, and the distance covered within
        the cell is given by \f$s_q\f$. The ID of the cell next to the exit point is denoted \f$m_q\f$
        and is easily determined as explained below.

        The algorithm that computes the exit point proceeds as follows:
         - Calculate the set of values \f$\{s_i\}\f$ for the intersection points between the line
           \f$\mathcal{L}(s)\f$ and the planes defined by the neighbors or walls \f$m_i\f$
           (see below for details on the intersection calculation).
         - Select the smallest nonnegative value \f$s_q=\min\{s_i|s_i>0\}\f$ in the set to determine
           the exit point. The neighbor or wall ID with the same index \f$i\f$ determines the
           corresponding \f$m_q\f$.
         - If there is no nonnegative value in the set, no exit point has been found.

        To calculate \f$s_i\f$ for a regular neighbor \f$m_i\geq 0\f$, intersect the
        line \f$\mathcal{L}(s)=\mathbf{r}+s\,\mathbf{k}\f$ with the plane bisecting the points
        \f$\mathbf{p}(m_i)\f$ and \f$\mathbf{p}(m_r)\f$. An unnormalized vector perpendicular to
        this plane is given by \f[\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{p}(m_i)-\mathbf{p}(m_r)\f]
        and a point on the plane is given by
        \f[\mathbf{p}=\frac{\mathbf{p}(m_i)+\mathbf{p}(m_r)}{2}.\f] The equation
        of the plane can then be written as \f[\mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{p})=0.\f]
        Substituting \f$\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{r}+s_i\,\mathbf{k}\f$ and solving for \f$s_i\f$ provides
        \f[s_i=\frac{\mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{r})}{\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{k}}.\f]
        If \f$\mathbf{n}\cdot\mathbf{k}=0\f$ the line and the plane are parallel and there
        is no intersection. In that case no \f$s_i\f$ is added to the set of candidate
        exit points.

        To calculate \f$s_i\f$ for a wall \f$m_i<0\f$, substitute the appropriate normal and
        position vectors for the wall plane in this last formula. For example, for the left wall
        with \f$m_i=-1\f$ one has \f$\mathbf{n}=(-1,0,0)\f$ and \f$\mathbf{p}=(x_\text{min},0,0)\f$
        so that \f[s_i=\frac{x_\text{min}-r_x}{k_x}.\f]
