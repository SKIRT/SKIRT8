/** The DustGrid class is an abstract base class for dust grids. It represents a collection of dust
    cells, which together divide a given configuration space. Each position in the computational
    domain corresponds to a single dust cell. The dust grid only contains the purely geometric

    (that information is contained in the DustSystem class). */
