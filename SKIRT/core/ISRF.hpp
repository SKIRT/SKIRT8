/** This namespace offers functions to obtain the interstellar radiation field in the solar
    neighborhood, sampled at the simulation's wavelength grid points. The user can choose between
    two different implementations of the ISRF. The first one is the ISRF as in Mathis et al. (1983,
    A&A, 128, 212), which is essentially a sum of three diluted blackbodies with a UV extension.
    The second option is the ISRF as in Kruegel (2007), which is read from a tabulated file
    (derived from the book using Dexter). */
