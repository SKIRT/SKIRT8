/** The StaggeredAssigner class is a subclass of the ProcessAssigner class, representing objects
    that assign work to different processes. An object of the StaggeredAssigner class distributes
    the work amongst the different processes in a staggered way. This means that the first value
    (index zero) is assigned to the first process (index zero), the second value to the second, and
    so on until the cycle is repeated with the first process and the indices exceeding the number
    of processes. This kind of assignment is useful if the CPU time is not expected to be the same
    for the different tasks, but is a function of the index of each tasks. An example is the
    simulation of the life cycle of photon packages, for which the CPU time depends on the
    wavelength. An efficient parallelization of the simulation over the wavelengths therefore
    requires an object of the StaggeredAssigner class, in order to obtain a good load balancing
    amongst the parallel processes. After performing the work in parallel, communication is
    typically needed to accumulate the results stored at different processes. */

    //============= Construction - Setup - Destruction =============

public:
    /** This constructor can be invoked by SKIRT classes that wish to hard-code the creation of a new
    ProcessAssigner object of this type (as opposed to creation through the ski file). Before the
    constructor returns, the newly created object is hooked up as a child to the specified parent
    in the simulation hierarchy (so it will automatically be deleted) and the setup of the
    ProcessAssigner base class is invoked, which sets the _comm attribute that points to the object
    of type PeerToPeerCommunicator that is found in the simulation hierarchy. As the second
    argument, it takes the number of parts of work \f$n\f$ that need to be performed. Based on this
    number, the number of processes and the rank of this process, this function determines the
    number of tasks that are assigned to this process and stores it in the _assigned member. This is
    done as follows. First, a pointer to the PeerToPeerCommunicator object is obtained by using the
    find operation. Then, in a loop over all indices \f$t\f$ from zero to \f$n-1\f$, it is checked
    whether the process, which has rank \f$i\f$ is assigned to the value with index \f$t\f$. If
    this is so, the \c _assigned member is incremented. The condition that is checked for each index
    \f$t\f$ can be written mathematically as: \f[ t \bmod{N_P} = i \f] where \f$N_P\f$ is the
    number of processes and \f$i\f$ is the rank of the process. */

        \f$t\f$ is determined by the following formula: \f[ t = i + u \cdot N_P \f] where \f$i\f$
        is the rank of the process, \f$u\f$ is the relative index and \f$N_P\f$ is the number of

        assigned to this process, _assigned. This relative index \f$u\f$ is determined by the
        following formula: \f[ u = \frac{t - i}{N_P} \f] where \f$i\f$ is the rank of the process,
        \f$t\f$ is the absolute index and \f$N_P\f$ is the number of processes. */
