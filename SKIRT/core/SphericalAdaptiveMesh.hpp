/** The SphericalAdaptiveMesh class is used to import data into SKIRT defined on a
    three-dimensional Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) grid using spherical coordinates
    \f$(r,\theta,\phi)\f$. The constructor reads the relevant data from a data file in one of the
    supported formats. The instance methods allow interrogating the resulting data structure in
    various ways. Once an AdaptiveMesh instance has been constructed, its data is never modified
    (which is somewhat ironic in view of the class name). Consequently all methods are re-entrant.

    An SphericalAdaptiveMesh instance represents one or more scalar fields over a given shell between
    inner radius \f$r_\text{in}\f$ and outer radius \f$r_\text{out}\f$. The meaning of the fields, and
    the units in which the values are expressed, are not relevant for this class and are determined
    by the caller in agreement with the supplier of the data file. Since at least one of the fields
    will likely be interpreted as a density distribution over the domain, this class offers some
    specific functionality to support that use case.

    For more information on the nested cell structure of an adaptive mesh, refer to the AdaptiveMesh
    class. For more information on the supported adaptive mesh file formats, refer to the
    AdaptiveMeshFile class and its subclasses. */

        fieldIndices argument specifies a list of indices \f$g\f$ for the scalar fields
        \f$F_g({\bf{r}})\f$ that will be held by the newly constructed instance. The exact meaning
        of the field indices depends on the imported data file format, but usually they correspond
        to zero-based column or variable indices. The data file must contain a sufficient number of
        columns or variables to accommodate the highest index in the list; additional columns or
        variables in the file are ignored. The indices may be specified in any order, and the same
        index may be specified more than once. Negative value are ignored. The arguments \em
        rin and \em rout specify the inner and outer radius of the shell comprising the domain. */

        factor for the density distribution. Finally, the density is always multiplied by the
        constant fraction \f$f\f$ specified by \em densityFraction (with a default value of 1). In
