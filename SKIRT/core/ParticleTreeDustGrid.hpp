/** ParticleTreeDustGrid is a concrete subclass of the BoxDustGrid class, representing
    three-dimensional dust grids with cuboidal cells organized in a tree. This class is similar to
    the TreeDustGrid class, except that the structure of the tree is determined by a set of
    particle locations retrieved from the dust distribution through the DustParticleInterface
    interface. In a first step the tree is subdivided in such a way that each leaf cell contains at
    most one particle. Subsequently each leaf node can be further subdivided a fixed number of
    times. Depending on the type of TreeNode, the tree can become an octtree (8 children per node)
    or a kd-tree (2 children per node). Other node types could be implemented, as long as they are
    cuboids lined up with the axes. The current implementation always uses regular (geocentric)
    subdivision and top-down search for locating cells. */

        \f$m\f$ of the node in the ID vector if the node is a leaf, and the number -1 if the node
        is not a leaf (and hence not a dust cell). Finally, the function logs some details on the
