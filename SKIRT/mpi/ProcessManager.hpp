/** The ProcessManager class is an interface to the MPI library, and is the only place in the SKIRT
    code where explicit calls to this library are allowed. The ProcessManager class acts as a
    resource manager, with the resource being MPI. This resource is only available once at a time.
    Therefore, the ProcessManager ensures that the usage rights for MPI are only acquired when it
    is not yet requested at that time.

    A single instance of the ProcessManager class must be constructed just after program startup,
    and before the command-line arguments are used by other parts of the program. The latter is
    important because the MPI initialization functions called by the ProcessManager constructor may
    adjust the command-line arguments to remove MPI specific options. The program should not use
    the exit() or abort() functions, but rather let the main() function run to normal completion
    and return an exit code. Except for the constructor and destructor, all public functions in
    this class are static and thread-safe. */

        process individually. The count arguments determine the number of times the patterns will
        be repeated. The shape of such a pattern consists of blocks of which the length is
        determined by the length arguments. The starting point of each block is placed at a
        multiple of the block length, and the amount empty space between the blocks will therefore
        also be a multiple of the block length. The exact locations where the blocks need to be
