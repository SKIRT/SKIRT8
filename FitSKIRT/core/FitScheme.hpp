/** FitScheme is the abstract base class that represents a complete FitSKIRT fit scheme. The class
    inherits SimulationItem so that all functionality built for SKIRT simulation hierarchies
    (including the discovery mechanism) can also be used for fit schemes. A FitScheme instance sits
    at the top of a run-time fit scheme hierarchy (i.e. it has no parent). It holds a number of
    essential fit-scheme-wide property instances. Some of these (a system of units) are
    discoverable and hence fully user-configurable. The other properties (a file paths object, a
    logging mechanism, a master-slave communicator) are not discoverable. When a FitScheme instance
    is constructed, a default instance is created for each of these properties. A reference to
    these property instances can be retrieved through the corresponding getter, and in some cases,
    the property can be further configured under program control (e.g., to set the input and output
    file paths for the fit scheme). */
